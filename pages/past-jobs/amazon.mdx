<Steps>
### Part-time Temp & 'Blue Badge' Associate

- **Seniority:** T1
- Paul started working for Amazon during college and shifted to full-time as a ship clerk upon graduation from UPJ
- He was responsible for picking order items from the warehouse floor and loading packages and trucks on the dock

### Ship Dock Process Assistant

- **Seniority:** T3
- Once [promoted](/past-jobs/amazon/ship-clerk), he was responsible for supervising the outbound ship dock
- That meant creating and issuing BOLs and sending the right trailer to the right location (*sometimes it ends up in another state*)

### Yard Specialist

- **Seniority:** L3
- In Paul's initial plan for 2019, he was to be trained as a [yard jockey](/past-jobs/amazon/jockey-trainee)

### RTS Shift Assistant

- **Seniority:** L3
- However there was a new Delivery Station opening--the first of its kind in his area
- So he was hired as an RTS Shift Assistant based on the recommendation of his previous manager

### RTS Shift Manager

- **Seniority:** L4
- After proving himself during Peak Season, he was hired as an RTS Shift Manager
- Created spreadsheets for tracking and forecasting throughput as they had a tendency to overproduce and cause a backup 2/3rds through the shift

### Loadout Area Manager

- **Seniority:** L5
- When training to manage a new process, I noticed that each separate hour of work produced drasically different throughput
- The first hour of work was far less productive than the second, and in the third hour, we often overproduced-using up all of our available containers
- I analyzed this problem by pulling from `tableau` using `VBA` to calculate the throughput after each database update (*5-10 minutes*)
- After collecting this data, I created an Excel spreadsheet to forecast the staffing needs (*15 minutes*) and alert the manager to both high and low throughput
- After Peak that season, he left because the `SAFETY` **rhetoric** never manifested into **reality**
