**FAQs:**

1. **How would you handle a situation where a camper is afraid to try ziplining?**
   "Approach with empathy, first discussing their fears to understand their perspective. Explain the safety measures in place and encouraging them to watch others before trying. Emphasize that it’s okay to feel scared and offer alternatives if they still don’t feel ready, ensuring they feel supported without pressure."

2. **Describe your approach to teaching a group of campers with mixed skill levels in kayaking.**
   "Assess each camper's experience level and divide them into smaller groups based on skill. Provide foundational safety instructions and demonstrations for everyone while offering advanced techniques to more experienced campers. By facilitating peer support and maintaining engagement through tailored instruction, all campers are ensured to learn at their own pace."

3. **How do you manage group dynamics during competitive activities like paintball?**
   "Set clear rules emphasizing sportsmanship before the game and monitor interactions closely. If tensions rise, call a timeout to allow campers to cool down and remind them of the importance of teamwork. After the activity, lead a debrief to reflect on experiences, turning conflicts into learning opportunities about cooperation and emotional management, while celebrating positive behaviors observed during the game."
